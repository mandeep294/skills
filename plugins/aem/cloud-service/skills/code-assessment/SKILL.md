  Detect, review, and fix code-quality and correctness issues in an AEM as a Cloud Service
  project — locally, with no external services or network calls. Use whenever a user wants to
  check, review, assess, audit, scan, modernize, upgrade, or fix AEM Java, Sling Models, OSGi,
  or Maven code — for example: "check my Sling Models are implemented correctly", "review my
  @Inject usage", "are my Maven dependencies up to date", "scan this AEM project for issues",
  "modernize my Sling Models", or "fix code-quality problems". Name the files to assess, or ask
  it to scan the repo; it detects issues, plans, and — only when you ask — applies surgical
  edits on a branch or in place, then verifies with mvn compile. It recognises the intent and
  handles each issue type itself, reporting anything it cannot yet fix.

# AEM as a Cloud Service — Code Assessment

Single skill for detecting and fixing AEM CS code-quality issues, **entirely against the local workspace** — no external services or network calls. Findings reach the runbook from one of two sources; everything downstream is identical.

## Findings sources

| Source | When | Target versions (deps) |
|---|---|---|
| **User-named** | the user names files or coordinates | user-supplied |
| **Discover** | the user asks to scan, or names no files | user-supplied (per the pattern's resolution contract) |

Discovery runs through the deterministic **analyzer** ([`scripts/analyze.sh`](scripts/README.md)):
it parses the workspace once and runs the enabled detectors, emitting the shared findings shape.
Patterns without an analyzer detector yet fall back to an LLM `scan` — see
[`references/patterns.md`](references/patterns.md).

## Routing

1. **User named files / coordinates** → run the runbook in `with_findings` mode against those paths.
2. **"Scan my repo" / no files named** → run the runbook in `discover` mode (per-pattern Discovery, workspace roots only).

Then follow the runbook: [`references/runbook.md`](references/runbook.md).

## Manual Pattern Hints (classification → expert skill)

Route the request to one expert skill:

| User said / saw | Expert skill |
|---|---|
| "update aem sdk", "upgrade mockito", stale `<version>` or `${property}` in pom | [`outdated-dependencies/`](outdated-dependencies/SKILL.md) |
| "fix @Inject", "modernize Sling Models", `javax.inject.Inject` on `@Model` fields | [`inject-in-sling-model/`](inject-in-sling-model/SKILL.md) |

**Broad / correctness-review asks** ("check my Sling Models are implemented correctly", "review my code", "is my AEM project healthy", "assess this project") are not a single pattern: run the runbook in `discover` mode with intent `report` — the analyzer runs every detector and the report covers all built patterns, explicitly noting aspects not yet supported. Only narrow to one pattern when the user targets a specific fix.

If nothing matches, say the issue is not yet supported and offer to file a request for a new expert skill.

**Full catalog** (built + `planned` patterns, with severity / detection / fix): [`references/patterns.md`](references/patterns.md).

## Runbook

All detection, planning, edits, verification, git/in-place handling, and the run log live in
[`references/runbook.md`](references/runbook.md). The runbook is the **sole owner** of repo-environment
detection (`edit_mode`, git snapshot) — this control plane does not duplicate it.

## One pattern per session

Report may span every pattern found; **apply touches one pattern per session** (atomic revert,
single-story diff). Refuse "fix everything" for the apply phase. Rationale:
[`references/shared-principles.md`](references/shared-principles.md#one-pattern-per-session).

## Critical rules

- **Local only** — no network calls or external services; operate solely on the workspace.
- **Requires a local JDK** (Java 11+) for detection — the analyzer compiles/runs in memory; no
  install beyond the JDK, no network. If absent, detection stops with a clear message.
- **The analyzer is detection — never substitute external tooling.** Do not run
  `mvn versions:display-dependency-updates` / `mvn versions:display-property-updates`,
  `npm outdated`, or Maven Central / registry lookups in place of analyzer discovery. Those answer
  "what is the latest on the network" — outside this skill's local-only contract. If the user
  explicitly wants a live registry comparison, say it needs network and offer it as a separate step
  **after** delivering the skill report.
- **Never commit, push, or open a PR** — branch (git) or in-place edits only; the developer reviews and commits.
- **Surgical edits** — no reformatting / re-serialization.
- **Skip with a reason** — record un-applicable findings as `skipped` with an exact reason; never silently drop.
- **One pattern per session** for apply.

Full rationale: [`references/shared-principles.md`](references/shared-principles.md).

## Scope & limitations

Local static detection and remediation only — no external services, no network, no live AEM instance. Issues that require runtime or live-repository state, telemetry, or history across runs are out of scope for this skill.
Detection requires a local JDK (Java 11+); there is no remote or LLM-scan fallback in this version.

## Adding a new pattern

Full end-to-end procedure — detector → fixtures/tests → catalog + routing → expert skill → verify:
**[`references/adding-a-pattern.md`](references/adding-a-pattern.md)**. The `[wiring]` test keeps the
detector, catalog row, and expert-skill directory in sync.

**Triggering scales without touching the description.** The `description` above is intentionally
broad (intent verbs + AEM domain), so it already fires on "check / review / fix my &lt;AEM thing&gt;";
a new pattern is reached by its **Manual Pattern Hints + `patterns.md` rows**, not by editing the
description. Update the description **only** if the new pattern introduces a domain keyword it does
not already cover (a new subsystem or file type). The `[wiring]` test keeps the detector, catalog
row, and expert-skill directory in sync.
