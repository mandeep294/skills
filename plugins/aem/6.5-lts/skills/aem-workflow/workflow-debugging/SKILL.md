# AEM Workflow Debugging — 6.5 LTS / AMS

Production-grade debugging for AEM Granite Workflow engine, launcher, Inbox, Sling Jobs, thread pools, and purge on **AEM 6.5 LTS** and **Adobe Managed Services (AMS)**.

## Variant Scope

- This skill is **6.5-lts-only** (includes AMS).
- Full JMX access via Felix Console or JMX client.
- Config changes via Felix Console or OSGi config in repository.

---

## When to use this skill

- Workflow stuck, not progressing, failed, not starting, task not in Inbox, purge/repository bloat, permissions, queue backlog, thread pool exhaustion, auto-advancement not working.
- User provides thread dumps, configuration status ZIPs, Sling Job console output, or error.log excerpts.
- Environment: AEM 6.5 LTS / AMS (JMX available).

## Step 1: Map symptom to runbook

| Symptom | symptom_id | Runbook | First action |
|---------|------------|---------|--------------|
| Workflow stuck (not advancing) | workflow_stuck_not_progressing | runbook-workflow-stuck.md | Open instance; note current step type. No work item → stale. |
| Task not in Inbox | task_not_in_inbox | runbook-task-not-in-inbox.md | Confirm Participant step; assignee = logged-in user; Inbox filters. |
| Workflow not starting (launcher) | workflow_not_starting_launcher | runbook-launcher-not-starting.md | Launcher enabled; path/event match payload. |
| Workflow fails or shows error | workflow_fails_or_shows_error | runbook-workflow-fails-or-shows-error.md | Instance history; error.log for instance ID; payload and process. |
| Step failed, retries exhausted | step_failed_retries_exhausted | runbook-failed-work-items.md | Logs → process.label → JMX `retryFailedWorkItems` or Inbox retry. |
| Stale (no current work item) | stale_workflow_no_work_item | runbook-stale-workflows.md | JMX `countStaleWorkflows` → `restartStaleWorkflows(dryRun=true)`. |
| Repository bloat / too many instances | repository_bloat_too_many_instances | runbook-purge-and-cleanup.md | JMX `purgeCompleted(dryRun=true)` or Purge Scheduler. |
| User cannot see or complete item | user_cannot_see_or_complete_item | runbook-inbox-and-permissions.md | Assignee/initiator/superuser; enforce flags. |
| Cannot delete model | cannot_delete_model | runbook-model-delete-and-update.md | JMX `countRunningWorkflows` → terminate → delete. |
| Slow throughput / queue backlog | slow_throughput_queue_backlog | runbook-job-throughput-and-concurrency.md | JMX `returnSystemJobInfo`; `queue.maxparallel` on Granite Workflow Queue; Sling thread pool. |
| Auto-advancement not working | workflow_auto_advance_failure | runbook-job-throughput-and-concurrency.md | Check `default` thread pool saturation; Sling Scheduler; timeout jobs. |
| New workflow not working | workflow_setup_validation | runbook-validate-workflow-setup.md | Model sync, launcher, process registration, permissions. |

---

## Step 2: Decision tree (workflow stuck)

1. **No current work item?** → Stale. JMX: `countStaleWorkflows` → `restartStaleWorkflows(dryRun=true)`.
2. **Participant step** → Assignee exists? Inbox visible? Payload accessible? Dynamic participant resolver returning correct user?
3. **Process step** → Search error.log for instance ID. Check: `process.label` registered, payload path exists, bundle active, no exception in `execute()`.
4. **OR/AND Split** → Condition evaluates correctly? Routes exist? No dead-end branches? Model synced?

---

## Step 3: Thread dump & thread pool analysis

Thread dumps on 6.5 / AMS are obtained via **jstack** or by requesting from AMS support. Configuration status ZIPs from **Felix Console → Status → Configuration Status**.

### 3a. Sling `default` thread pool (critical path)

The Sling Scheduler `ApacheSlingdefault` uses `ThreadPool: default`. This pool fires:
- `com/adobe/granite/workflow/timeout/job` (auto-advancement)
- Oak observation events
- All Quartz-scheduled jobs

**Check the Sling Thread Pools status page (`/system/console/status-slingthreadpools`):**

| Field | Healthy | Problem |
|-------|---------|---------|
| active count | < max pool size | **= max pool size** (saturated) |
| block policy | RUN | **ABORT** (rejects tasks when full) |
| max pool size | ≥ 20 | Low values starve schedulers |

**If active count = max pool size AND block policy = ABORT:**
- New scheduled tasks (including workflow timeout/auto-advance jobs) are **silently rejected**
- This is the #1 cause of auto-advancement failure

**Check the Threads status page (`/system/console/status-Threads`) or the jstack thread dump (`/system/console/status-jstack-threaddump`):**
- Search for `sling-default-` threads
- If all threads show same stack (e.g. stuck on HTTP call, database, or external service), that's the blocking culprit
- Note `elapsed` time — threads stuck for hours indicate a hung external call without timeout

### 3b. Sling Job thread pool

**Check `Apache Sling Job Thread Pool`** in the Sling Thread Pools status page:
- active count vs max pool size
- If saturated, Sling Jobs cannot execute (workflow jobs stall)

### 3c. Granite Workflow Queue

**Check the Sling Jobs page (`/system/console/slingevent`):**

| Field | Healthy | Problem |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Queued Jobs (overall) | 0 | > 0 (jobs waiting) |
| Failed Jobs | 0 | > 0 (step failures) |
| Active Jobs | 0-N | 0 when Queued > 0 (jobs not picked up) |

**Check topic statistics for workflow model:**
- Topic: `com/adobe/granite/workflow/job/var/workflow/models/<modelName>`
- High `Failed Jobs` / low `Finished Jobs` ratio → process step throwing exceptions

**Check Granite Workflow Queue configuration:**
- Type: Topic Round Robin
- Max Parallel: 0.5 OOTB on AEM 6.5 LTS (50% of available CPU cores). Increase for throughput on bursty workloads. Verify the running value at `/system/console/configMgr/org.apache.sling.event.jobs.QueueConfiguration~workflow` before assuming.
- Max Retries: 10

### 3d. Sling Scheduler

**Check the Sling Scheduler status page (`/system/console/status-slingscheduler`):**
- Verify `com/adobe/granite/workflow/timeout/job` scheduled jobs exist
- `nextFireTime: null` → job already fired or deregistered
- Verify which ThreadPool the scheduler uses (should be `default`)

## Step 4: Error log patterns

| Pattern | Cause | Action |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `Error executing workflow step` | Process step exception | Check stack; fix process code or payload |
| `getProcess for '<name>' failed` | No WorkflowProcess registered | Deploy bundle; match `process.label` |
| `Cannot archive workitem` | Archive failure → stale risk | JMX `restartStaleWorkflows` |
| `refreshing the session since we had to wait for a lock` | Lock contention | Tune `queue.maxparallel` on the Granite Workflow Queue (Apache Sling Job Queue Configuration); reduce concurrent writes to the same path |
| `Terminate failed` / `Resume failed` / `Suspend failed` | Permissions (not initiator/superuser) | Check `enforceWorkflowInitiatorPermissions`; add to superusers |
| `PathNotFoundException` (workflow/payload) | Payload/launcher path missing | Verify payload exists; check launcher config path |
| `Error adding launcher config` | Launcher config path not created | Create `/conf/global/settings/workflow/launcher/config` |
| `retrys exceeded - remove isTransient` | Transient workflow failed after retries | Fix process code; instance persisted for admin handling |
| `RejectedExecutionException` | Thread pool full with ABORT policy | Increase pool size or change policy to RUN; fix stuck threads |
| `Workflow is already finished` | Terminate on completed/aborted instance | Check logic calling terminate |
| `Workflow purge '<name>' : repository exception` | Purge JCR error | Check permissions; repo health |

---

## Step 5: Configuration checklist

**In Felix Console → OSGi → Configuration (`/system/console/configMgr`):**

| Config | Property | Check |
|--------|----------|-------|
| WorkflowSessionFactory | `cq.workflow.job.retry` | Default 3; increase for flaky steps |
| Apache Sling Job Queue Configuration (Granite Workflow Queue) | `queue.maxparallel` | Workflow parallelism. Default 1; increase for throughput. The `cq.workflow.job.max.procs` property shown on WorkflowSessionFactory has no runtime effect — do not rely on it |
| WorkflowSessionFactory | `granite.workflow.enforceWorkitemAssigneePermissions` | true = only assignee sees items |
| WorkflowSessionFactory | `granite.workflow.enforceWorkflowInitiatorPermissions` | true = only initiator can terminate |
| WorkflowSessionFactory | `cq.workflow.superuser` | Must include admin users/groups |
| DefaultThreadPool (default) | `block policy` | ABORT can reject timeout jobs; prefer RUN |
| DefaultThreadPool (default) | `max pool size` | 20 default; increase if many schedulers |
| Granite Workflow Queue | `queue.maxparallel` | 0.5 OOTB (50% of CPU cores); increase for throughput. Verify at `/system/console/configMgr/org.apache.sling.event.jobs.QueueConfiguration~workflow` |
| Purge Scheduler | `scheduledpurge.daysold` | 30 default; tune per environment |

---

## Step 6: Remediation quick reference

| Action | 6.5 LTS / AMS approach |
|--------|----------------------|
| Retry failed work item | JMX `retryFailedWorkItems` or Inbox Retry |
| Restart stale workflows | JMX `restartStaleWorkflows(dryRun=true)` then execute |
| Purge completed | JMX `purgeCompleted(dryRun=true)` or Purge Scheduler |
| Increase parallelism | Felix Console: `queue.maxparallel` on the Granite Workflow Queue (Apache Sling Job Queue Configuration); or OSGi config in repo |
| Fix thread pool exhaustion | Restart instance (immediate); fix stuck scheduler code; change block policy to RUN |
| Fix process not found | Deploy bundle; `process.label` must match; Sync model |
| Fix auto-advancement | Verify `default` pool not saturated; timeout jobs scheduled; block policy = RUN |

---

## Step 7: Key JMX MBeans

All workflow maintenance and diagnostic operations live on a single MBean: `com.adobe.granite.workflow:type=Maintenance`. A separate MBean — `com.adobe.granite.workflow:type=Statistics` — exposes time-series workflow execution metrics for trend analysis.

| MBean | Operations | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| `com.adobe.granite.workflow:type=Maintenance` | `purgeCompleted(model, days, dryRun)`, `purgeActive(model, days, dryRun)`, `countRunningWorkflows(model)`, `countCompletedWorkflows(model)`, `countStaleWorkflows(model)`, `restartStaleWorkflows(model)`, `retryFailedWorkItems(dryRun, model)`, `returnSystemJobInfo`, `returnWorkflowQueueInfo`, `returnWorkflowJobTopicInfo`, `returnFailedWorkflowCount(model)`, `terminateFailedInstances`, `fetchModelList` | Purge, stale detection/restart, retry failed items, failure handling, queue/job diagnostics, model enumeration |
| `com.adobe.granite.workflow:type=Statistics` | `getResults`, `clearRecords`; plus `get`/`set` accessors for `DataLifeTime`, `DataFidelityTime`, `DataProcessRate`, `DataRate` | Time-series workflow execution statistics |

**Always use `dryRun=true` first before executing destructive purge or retry operations.**

## Step 8: Common root cause patterns (from real incidents)

### Pattern A: Thread pool starvation → auto-advance failure

**Symptom:** Workflow auto-advancement stops; timeout jobs not firing; workflows stuck at participant step despite timeout configured.

**Root cause chain:**
1. Custom scheduler (e.g. `AccessTokenScheduler`) makes blocking HTTP call without timeout
2. `concurrent = true` allows overlapping executions on each cron trigger
3. Each stuck execution consumes a `default` pool thread indefinitely
4. All 20 threads consumed → pool saturated
5. Block policy = ABORT → new Quartz jobs rejected silently
6. Workflow timeout jobs (`com/adobe/granite/workflow/timeout/job`) cannot fire
7. Auto-advancement never happens

**Diagnosis checklist:**
- [ ] Sling Thread Pools page (`/system/console/status-slingthreadpools`): Pool `default` → active count = max pool size?
- [ ] Sling Thread Pools page: Pool `default` → block policy = ABORT?
- [ ] Threads page (`/system/console/status-Threads`) or jstack: All `sling-default-*` threads stuck on same stack?
- [ ] Sling Jobs page (`/system/console/slingevent`): Workflow job topic has high Failed Jobs?
- [ ] Sling Scheduler page (`/system/console/status-slingscheduler`): ThreadPool = `default` for `ApacheSlingdefault`?

**Fix:** Restart instance (immediate); fix scheduler code (add HTTP timeout, set `concurrent=false`); change pool policy to RUN; increase pool size.

### Pattern B: High workflow job failure rate

**Symptom:** `numberOfFailedJobs` >> `numberOfFinishedJobs` for a workflow topic.

**Root cause:** Process step exception, payload deleted, or process not registered.

**Diagnosis:** Search error.log for `Error executing workflow step` + model name. Check `process.label` in Felix Console → OSGi Components.

### Pattern C: Stale workflows accumulating

**Symptom:** Workflows in RUNNING state but no work items; Inbox empty despite running instances.

**Root cause:** `Cannot archive workitem` during transition; JCR session crash during step completion.

**Diagnosis:** Search for `Cannot archive workitem`; JMX `countStaleWorkflows`; `restartStaleWorkflows(dryRun=true)`.
